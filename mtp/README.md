# Telephone User Behavior Class Prediction App

This is a Flask web application that predicts user behavior class based on various input features. The application uses a machine learning model trained with scikit-learn. We experimented with different models and ultimately chose a Random Forest classifier for its superior performance.

## Project Introduction

This dataset downloaded from Kaggle, provides a comprehensive analysis of mobile device usage patterns and user behavior classification. It contains 700 samples of user data, including metrics such as app usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, and data consumption. Each entry is categorized into one of five user behavior classes, ranging from light to extreme usage, allowing for insightful analysis and modeling.

### Key Features:

- **User ID:** Unique identifier for each user.
- **Device Model:** Model of the user's smartphone.
- **Operating System:** The OS of the device (iOS or Android).
- **App Usage Time:** Daily time spent on mobile applications, measured in minutes.
- **Screen On Time:** Average hours per day the screen is active.
- **Battery Drain:** Daily battery consumption in mAh.
- **Number of Apps Installed:** Total apps available on the device.
- **Data Usage:** Daily mobile data consumption in megabytes.
- **Age:** Age of the user.
- **Gender:** Gender of the user (Male or Female).
- **User Behavior Class:** Classification of user behavior based on usage patterns (1 to 5).

## Features

- Input form for user data
- Prediction of user behavior class
- Example data autofill
